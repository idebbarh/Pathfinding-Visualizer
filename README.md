## Pathfinding Visualizer

The Pathfinding Visualizer is a tool that allows users to see how different search algorithms find the shortest path between two points on a grid. It is implemented using vanilla JavaScript and includes several well-known search algorithms such as Dijkstra's, A\*, DFS, and BFS. These algorithms are used to find the shortest path between two points by searching through a graph of interconnected nodes. The project also includes a maze generator that uses the recursive division algorithm.
